# Title of the Article
## Why you are wrong and I am right, read this to find out.

This is a brief introduction paragraph explaining the title of the article, and why I happen to be right and you happen to be wrong. It is difficult to get a sense of things without having something to really look at.

I just made a paragraph break to help separate things a bit. Let's jump into the thick of things now.

### First Point: We need to figure this out.

Man we really screwed the pooch on this one.

#### Sub-point to the first one: isn't this neat.

We suck.

##### Update

We still suck.

###### Finally, pineapples.

Everything is garbage. Never. Love. *Anything.*
