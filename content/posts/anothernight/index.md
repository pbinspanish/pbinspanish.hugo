Another night,  
Another day washed away.  
Frenzied thoughts; productivity haze,  
What was planned, now fades.

Another night,  
Another chance to evade dismay.  
But staring and clicking prevail,  
As aspirations turn to grey.

Another cycle,  
Another repetition of past today.  
You had your chance,   
And squandered it away. 

Another night,  
Enter sleep with hope.  
To break the cycle; to live again,  
Another day.
