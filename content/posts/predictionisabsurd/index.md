Past you is not you and neither is future you.
I have a feeling my ignorance and lack of experience might color this article quite heavily.



My inspiration for this post comes from my current experiences with applying to jobs and dealing with interview questions. Some of the ones that come up a lot are questions of the nature "Where do you see yourself in X years?". 

I *really* dislike questions like these, and I want to take a moment to explain exactly why.

# What's the point?
What is an interviewer trying to gain from asking this question? And I don't mean in corporate work, where they might expect a reponse that encourages them about you still working for them in that time (since onboarding is a time consuming, expensive, and generally unpleasant process). I mean in jobs like part-time retail work, where the expectation is that you're gone in 3 months to a year.
