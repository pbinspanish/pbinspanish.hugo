![Picture of Me](images/profile.png)

My name is Josiah Henson, and I am a Computer Science student studying at the University of Windsor. I'm passionate about technology, music, and physical fitness. I love reading books, playing soccer, and experimenting with technology. If I'm not on a field or in the gym, I'm inside reading a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/mantecademani) or hacking away at the next project idea in my head. I want to share the things I'm passionate about through this blog, so if any of these things inspire you please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:josiahj.h@outlook.com).
